# KBase User Documentation

## DESCRIPTION

Documentation for KBase Users, written in Markdown + extensions, rendered with Pandoc,
and with a build process designed for both previewing and inclusion in the KBase wordpress web site.

## QUICK LOOK

Each document is stored in a directory which contains the main document (index.md) and any associated resources (images, styles).

The markup format is *Markdown*, with extensions provided by *Pandoc*. This allows an easy and widely supported markup style, but allows features advanced beyond what Markdown proper supports. 

This repo supports both previewing the documentation as HTML pages with your browser, and also preparation of the same documents for inclusion in the wordpress site. The preview pages include styles to emulate *kbase.us*, including bootstrap and KBase specializations of bootrap.
